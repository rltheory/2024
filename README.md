# RL theory 2024

Help with building the site locally:

1. Clone this directory locally (https://github.com/rltheory/rltheory-2024)
2. Install Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
3. Navitate to the repository folder and open a terminal inside it
4. Possibly you'll have to run ''bundle install''
5. Finally, run ''bundle exec jekyll serve''. Then the website will be available at localhost/4000 in the browser (or some link like that; the terminal will specify the link)

If everything looks good, you may push the changes to Github to update the website globally.
