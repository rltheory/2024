I"Ü<p>Batch learning is concerned with problems when a learning algorithm must work with data collected in some manner that is not under the control of the learning algorithm: on a batch of data.
In batch RL the data is given in the form of a sequence of trajectories of varying length, where each trajectory is of the form $\tau=(S_0,A_0,R_0,S_1,A_1,R_1,\dots,S_t,A_t,R_t,S_{t+1})$, where $A_i$ is chosen in a causal fashion (based on ‚Äúpast‚Äù data), $(R_t,S_{t+1})\sim Q_{A_t}(S_t)$, where $Q = (Q_a(s))_{s,a}$ is a collection of probability distributions over pairs of reals and states, as usual (when we want to allow stochastic rewards).</p>
