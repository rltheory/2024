I"@<h1 id="cmput-605-theoretical-foundations-of-reinforcement-learning-w2023">CMPUT 605: Theoretical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning W2023</h1>

<p>The purpose of this course is to let students acquire a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning, as well as to give students a glimpse on what theoretical research looks like in the context of computer science.
The topics will range from building up foundations (Markovian Decision Processes and the various special cases of it), to discussing solutions to two core problem settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>planning/simulation optimization, and</li>
  <li>online reinforcement learning</li>
</ul>

<p>In each of these settings, we cover key algorithmic challenges and the core ideas to address these. Specific topics, ideas and algorithms covered include, for each topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>complexity of planning/simulation optimization; large scale planning with function approximation;</li>
  <li>efficient online learning: the role (and limits) of optimism; scaling up with function approximation.</li>
</ul>

<p>While we will explore connections to (some) deep RL methods, mainly seeking an answer to the question of when we expect them to work well, the course will <em>not</em> focus on deep RL.</p>

<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Students taking the course are expected to have an understanding of basic probability, basics of concentration inequalities, linear algebra and convex optimization. This background is covered in Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7, 26, and 38 of the <a href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf">Bandit Algorithms book</a>. One very nice book that covers more, but is still highly recommended is <a href="http://people.bu.edu/pekoz/A_Second_Course_in_Probability-Ross-Pekoz.pdf">A Second Course in Probability Theory</a>. The book is available online and also in book format. Chapters 1, 3, 4, and 5 are most useful from here.</p>

<p>It will also be useful to recall foundations of mathematical analysis, such as completeness, metric spaces and alike, as we will start off with results that will require Banach’s fixed point theorem. This is covered, for example, in Appendix A of <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs.pdf">Csaba’s “little” RL book</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_fixed-point_theorem">wikipedia page</a> on Banach’s fixed point theorem is not that bad either.</p>

<!-- ## Grading

The students will be graded on four problem sheets (with one warm-up sheet), worth 10% of the grade each, and a midterm worth 20%. The problem sheets and mid-term ought to take around 12 hours each to complete to a good standard. The remaining 40% of the grade will be awarded based on the quality of the final project. The students will likely need to spend at least 10 hours each week reading, thinking and writing in order to produce a good project.

<!-- ## eClass
We will use eclass for assignment submissions. The link to join eClass can be found [here](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/course/view.php?id=76687).
We will not use eClass for announcements and discussions. For these we will use Slack. -->

<h2 id="slack-channel">Slack Channel</h2>
<p>We will use Slack for everything.
We have a channel called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#cmput-605-students</code> on the Amii slack to discuss all topics related for this course. 
<!-- This channel is open to anyone who is on Amii slack. -->
If you would like to join the channel please message Vlad Tkachuk (vtkachuk@ualberta.ca) for an invitation.
<!-- For discussions related to marking, assignment schedule, etc. we have a second channel `#cmput653-private-discussion-w2022`, which is by invitation only. -->
<!-- The TAs will add anyone who is taking the course for credit to these slack channels. -->
All announcements will be made on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#cmput-605-students</code>.
We strongly encourage all students to ask questions regarding course content on the Slack channel!</p>

<!-- ## Google Meet Information
The google meet information will be posted on the slack channel and on eClass.
This is relevant up to the point when teaching becomes in-person. -->

<!-- ## Grading Policies

<h2 id="lectures-notes">Lectures Notes</h2>
<p>The lecture notes for this year’s class are under the heading <strong>LECTURE NOTES</strong>.
The lecture notes for this year serve as the required text for this course.
Lecture notes for the last two years are available on this site under headings <strong>WINTER 2022 LECTURE NOTES</strong> and <strong>WINTER 2021 LECTURE NOTES</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>The work you will be required to do for this course includes 4 (marked) assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final project.
For all course work submissions please send your completed work to Vlad Tkachuk via private message on Slack before the due date.
More details can be found in <a href="/pages/assignments">The Work You Do</a> page.</p>

<!-- ## Flipped Class
For the first three weeks, as mentioned above, we will follow a flipped class format:
Students coming to class are required to
- read the associated lecture notes and/or watch the lecture recordings
- prepare and vote on questions on the slack discussion channel

In class time will be spent on a
- quick review of the material
- discussing the most voted questions
- small group discussions of various topics -->
