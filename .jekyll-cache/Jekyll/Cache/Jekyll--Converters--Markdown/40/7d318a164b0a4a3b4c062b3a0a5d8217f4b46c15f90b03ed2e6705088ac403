I"Ä<p>The lesson from the
<a href="/lecture-notes/planning-in-mdps/lec9/">last lecture</a> is that efficient planners
are limited to induce policies whose
suboptimaly gap is polynomially larger than the
misspecification error of the feature-map supplied to the planner.
We have
<a href="/lecture-notes/planning-in-mdps/lec8/">also seen</a>)
that if we accept this polynomial in the feature-space-dimension error amplification,
a relatively straightforward adaptation of policy iteration
gives rise to a computationally efficient (global) planner â€“ at least, when
the planner is furbished with the solution to an underlying optimal experimental design problem.
In any case, the planner is query efficient.</p>
